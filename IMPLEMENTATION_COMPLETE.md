# ✅ RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM COMPLETE

## What We Built
Simple post recommendation system that orders posts by user similarity in the existing `/api/posts/` endpoint.

## Key Features
- **Department Match**: Posts from same department appear first
- **Year Proximity**: Recent graduates see posts from similar graduation years
- **No Database Changes**: Uses existing User/AlumniProfile models
- **Zero Frontend Changes**: Works with current React app

## Files Modified
- `test_app/views.py` - Added similarity algorithm to PostListCreateView

## Test Files Created  
- `test_recommendation_system.py` - Algorithm validation
- `create_test_users.py` - Sample data generator
- `test_api_simple.py` - API testing utility

## How to Test
1. **Start server**: `python manage.py runserver`
2. **Test algorithm**: `python test_recommendation_system.py`
3. **Create sample data**: `python create_test_users.py`
4. **Test API**: Use browser/Postman to call `/api/posts/` with JWT auth

## Algorithm Summary
```python
def _calculate_user_similarity(self, user1_profile, user2_profile):
    score = 0
    
    # Department match (50 points)
    if user1_profile.department == user2_profile.department:
        score += 50
    
    # Graduation year proximity (40 points max)
    year_diff = abs(user1_profile.graduation_year - user2_profile.graduation_year)
    if year_diff == 0:
        score += 40
    elif year_diff == 1:
        score += 30
    elif year_diff == 2:
        score += 20
    else:
        score += 10
    
    # Similarity bonus (20 points)
    if score >= 70:
        score += 20
    
    return score
```

## ✅ Ready to Use!
The recommendation system is now live in your `/api/posts/` endpoint. Users will automatically see posts from similar alumni first!
